                    protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn
                    about your browser and operating system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    How do you get my consent?
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify
                    your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we
                    imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either
                    ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
                </p>

                <p>
                    How do I withdraw my consent?
                </p>

                <p>
                    If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact
                    you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by
                    contacting us at cuso@lackmail.ru or mailing us at:
                    Acme 123 any,
                    Anywhere, CA, 90210,
                    United States
                </p>

                <h3>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</h3>

                <p>
                    We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so
                    or if you violate our Terms of Service.
                </p>

                <h3>SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h3>

                <p>
                    In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your
                    information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment
                    transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we
                    are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can
                    understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities
                    that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect
                    to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service
                    provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s)
                    in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a
                    payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used
                    in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States
                    legislation, including the Patriot Act.
                </p>

                <p>

                    application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.
